## Class-Based-Component-Practice

A very basic project used to practice class based components in React.

## Key learnings:

Class based component Lifecycle Methods:

componentDidMount - useEffect equivalent suitible for API and Http requests as it only runs once on mount.

componentDidUpdate - useEffect equivalent suitible for cases where there is a changing dependancy.

componentWillUnmount - useEffect cleanup function equivalent.

componentDidCatch - Used in an ErrorBoundary component to catch errors and return alternate code.
