## Class-Based-Component-Practice

A very basic project used to practice class based components in React.

## Key learnings:

Class based component Lifecycle Methods:

**componentDidMount** - useEffect equivalent suitable for API and Http requests as it only runs once on mount.

**componentDidUpdate** - useEffect equivalent suitable for cases where there is a changing dependancy.

**componentWillUnmount** - useEffect cleanup function equivalent.

**componentDidCatch** - Used in an ErrorBoundary component to catch errors and return alternate code.
